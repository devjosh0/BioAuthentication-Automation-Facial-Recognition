# FacialRecognition

FacialRecognition is a Java-based automated test suite for a web application that supports facial recognition sign-up and login. It uses Selenium WebDriver and TestNG to automate browser interactions and validate the facial authentication workflow.

## Features

- Automated sign-up with randomly generated user credentials
- MP4 to Y4M video conversion for facial recognition testing
- Selenium-driven browser automation (Chrome)
- End-to-end test: sign up, set up biometrics, log in with face, and delete account
- TestNG-based test execution and reporting

## Project Structure

    java/
      Pages/      # Page Object Model classes for UI automation
      Utils/      # Utility classes (e.g., video conversion, test data)
    resources/
      face.mp4    # Sample video for facial recognition
      face.y4m    # Converted video for Selenium fake video capture

```

## Key Components

- [`Pages.SignUpPage`](src/main/java/Pages/SignUpPage.java): Automates user registration.
- [`Pages.BiometricsPage`](src/main/java/Pages/BiometricsPage.java): Handles biometric setup.
- [`Pages.LoginPage`](src/main/java/Pages/LoginPage.java): Automates login with facial recognition.
- [`Pages.DeleteAccount`](src/main/java/Pages/DeleteAccount.java): Deletes the test user account.
- [`Utils.ConvertMp4ToY4m`](src/main/java/Utils/ConvertMp4ToY4m.java): Converts MP4 video to Y4M format using FFmpeg.
- [`Utils.TestDataUtils`](src/main/java/Utils/TestDataUtils.java): Generates random test data.
- [`FaceSignUpTest`](src/test/java/FaceSignUpTest.java): Orchestrates the full test flow.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven
- Chrome browser
- FFmpeg (for video conversion)

## How to Run Headless

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```sh
   mvn test
   ```

## How to Run Headed or GUI

1. In your System Device Manager.
   Disable all physical webcams.
   Leave only OBS VirtualCam enabled.

2. Set the bin folder path of the FFmpeg to the Environment Variable
   ```sh 
   computerLocalPath+\ffmpeg-7.0.2-essentials_build\ffmpeg-7.0.2-essentials_build\bin
   ```

3. Download OBS Studio
   ```sh
   https://obsproject.com/download
   Open OBS Studio.
   In the Sources panel, click + â†’ choose Media Source(select video in directory src/main/resources/face.mp4).
   Enable Loop (so it plays continuously).
   Resize/fit it into the screen so it looks like a proper webcam feed.
   In OBS, click Start Virtual Camera (bottom-right corner).
   ```

4. Comments lines below in your src/test/java/FaceSignUpTest.java file
   ```sh
   options.addArguments("--headless=new"); 
   options.addArguments("--disable-gpu");
   ```

## Continuous Integration

- GitHub Actions workflow in [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](.github/workflows/main.yml) runs tests on push and pull requests.
- FFmpeg is installed automatically for video conversion.
- Test reports are archived as artifacts.

## Notes

- The test uses Chrome in headless mode and simulates webcam input using the converted Y4M video.
- Ensure `face.mp4` is present in `src/main/resources/` before running tests.
- The generated `face.y4m` is ignored by Git.
